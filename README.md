# Bootswatch/Bootstrap

Before continuing, ensure you've run npm install bootswatch in your local project folder. (Use either npm or yarn.)

Add the following import :
import "bootswatch/dist/[theme]/bootstrap.min.css";

In your Ruby project, you can access the latest version of each theme by adding the following to your Gemfile and running bundle install:
gem "bootswatch"
